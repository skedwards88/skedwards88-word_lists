# Word Lists

This repo takes several word lists and compiles them to a list of common words and a list of less common words.

## Usage

To use the word lists, `npm install @skedwards88/word_lists`. You may need to modify your `.npmrc` file to include `@skedwards88:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com/`. For more information, see [the GitHub docs on installing a package](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-npm-registry#installing-a-package).

## Contributing

Does `compiled/commonWords.txt` include a word that you think is _not_ commonly known, or does `compiled/uncommonWords.txt` include a word that you think _is_ commonly known? Feel free to open a pull request to modify `compiled/notActuallyCommon.txt` or `compiled/notActuallyUncommon.txt`, and run `npm run build` to compile the changes. Or, feel free to open an issue. All word choices is up to the discretion of the repository owner.

## Development

### Raw word lists

`raw/wordnik.txt` is an opensource wordlist from [Wordnik](https://github.com/wordnik/wordlist). It contains ~200,000 entries, plus a few entries that were added as per user request.

`raw/wiki.txt` is the word frequency on Wikipedia, compiled by https://github.com/IlyaSemenov/wikipedia-word-frequency. It contains ~2.6 million entries, including non-English entries.

`raw/gutenberg.txt` is the 40,000 most common words on Project Gutenberg, as compiled in the April 16, 2006 [list by Wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Frequency_lists#English).

`raw/movies.txt` is the 10,000 most common words from movies and TV, as compiled in the 2006 [list by Wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Frequency_lists#English).

`LDNOOBW.txt` is the "list of dirty, naughty, obscene, and otherwise bad words" from [LDNOOBW](https://github.com/LDNOOBW/List-of-Dirty-Naughty-Obscene-and-Otherwise-Bad-Words), minus multi-word phrases, minus words not in `raw/wordnik.txt`, minus words that were subjectively deemed to be non-offensive due to a non-slang or scientific meaning, plus variations of words.

### Processed word lists

Files were processed into files that contain words that also exist in the Wordnik list but not the LDNOOBW word list.

`processed/wordnik.txt` is `raw/wordnik.txt` minus words from `LDNOOBW.txt`. `processed/wordnik_processor.py` is the script that generated this file.

`processed/gutenberg.txt` is `raw/gutenberg.txt` minus words that do not exist in `processed/wordnik.txt`. `processed/gutenberg_processor.py` is the script that generated this file.

`processed/movies.txt` is `raw/movies.txt` minus words that do not exist in `processed/wordnik.txt`. `processed/movies_processor.py` is the script that generated this file.

`processed/wiki.txt` is `raw/wiki.txt`, minus words that words that do not exist in `processed/wordnik.txt`. `processed/wiki_frequency_processor.py` is the script that generated this file.

### Compiled word lists

`compiled/commonWords.txt` consists of words that are on common to wordnik, wiki, and gutenberg AND words that are common to wordnik and movies. It omits words from `LDNOOBW.txt`. In addition, the list excludes the manually compiled `compiled/notActuallyCommon.txt` that were deemed subjectively not common and includes the manually compiled `compiled/notActuallyUncommon.txt` that were deemed subjectively not uncommon.

`compiled/uncommonWords.json` consists of all of the wordnik words that are not in `compiled/commonWords.txt`, minus words from `LDNOOBW.txt`.

These files were generated by `compiled/compile.py`.
