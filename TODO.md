# TODO

- add tests
  - check that the exclusion lists don't overlap
- further divide uncommon words into obscure vs uncommon?
- make workflow to automatically trigger the lexlet/pallet/etc workflows once a new word list package publishes
- show all words in solutions, make scroll

## Plurals to evaluate
